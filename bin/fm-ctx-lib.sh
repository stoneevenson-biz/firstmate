# fm-ctx-lib.sh — shared pure primitives for the firstmate context watchdog.
#
# ONE source of truth for: the per-pane window KEY (so the statusline writer, the
# watch daemon, and the rehydrate bootstrap all agree on the same ctx-<key>.json /
# handoff-<key>.md filenames), ROLE classification (captain vs crew/secondmate),
# the restart THRESHOLDS, and the inject-size CAP. Sourced by fm-ctx-statusline.sh,
# fm-ctx-stop-hook.sh, and fm-context-watch.sh; the rehydrate path in
# fm-captain-bootstrap.sh reimplements the key/cap logic in python but keys off the
# SAME conventions defined here.
#
# All functions are `set -u`/`set -e` safe and side-effect-free (pure reads), so the
# unit tests source this file directly. No tmux/IO at source time.

# --- thresholds (env-overridable) -------------------------------------------
# CAPTAIN fires BELOW the 200k floor: a safety margin so the firstmate restarts
# before it can ever enter the "dumb zone", never at/after 200k. CREW/SECONDMATE
# restart at half their window — a cheap, frequent, low-stakes recycle — OR at a
# hard ABSOLUTE token ceiling (FM_CTX_CREW_FLOOR), whichever comes first: on a
# huge window 50% can still be a dangerous absolute size, so the floor catches a
# crew that is over the token ceiling even while under 50% of its window.
FM_CTX_CAPTAIN_FLOOR="${FM_CTX_CAPTAIN_FLOOR:-185000}"   # total context tokens
FM_CTX_CREW_PCT="${FM_CTX_CREW_PCT:-50}"                 # used_percentage
FM_CTX_CREW_FLOOR="${FM_CTX_CREW_FLOOR:-200000}"         # absolute total-token ceiling

# --- managed-scope (env-overridable) ----------------------------------------
# The MEASURE statusLine is GLOBAL (~/.claude/settings.json), so EVERY Claude
# session on the machine — including Stone's ad-hoc/personal ones — writes a
# ctx-<window>.json sentinel into firstmate's state/. The watchdog must NEVER
# /clear a session it does not own. The reliable, opt-in-by-construction signal
# for "firstmate owns this pane" is the tmux SESSION: fm-spawn.sh launches every
# crew/secondmate window (`fm-<id>`) AND the captain (Cortana) inside the single
# firstmate tmux session. So a pane is managed iff its tmux session is
# FM_TMUX_SESSION. Ad-hoc panes live in other sessions → not managed → never
# touched. (Override for nested/renamed deployments or tests.)
